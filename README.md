## Getting Started

The program should be able to run from the executable in the /bin/debug but if not one can recompile the code using Visual Studio. All packages should already be in the repo.

## Graphing Package

We use the LiveCharts package to render all of the plots. Information and source code can be found here: https://github.com/Live-Charts/Live-Charts
